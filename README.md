# FOSS_Hack-Who-Am-I
## Under FOSS Hackathon
"Male or Female" is what majority of people think when it comes to gender. But there are many many more genders - gender roles, gender identities, and gender expressions. As the humankind begins to understand gender better, it is natural that people would want to learn more about it - to understand gender of others and of their own. This project can be a multilingual website or an app that helps people learn about genders.
